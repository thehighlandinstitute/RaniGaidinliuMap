            description: 'The birth place of Rani Gaidinliu (1915-1993). In popular accounts, Rani Gaidinliu was born under auspicious signs. Under clear skies, lightning flashed during her birth, frightening the villagers and stopping only five days later. Gaidinliu’s mother, Karotlenliu, saw an angel in her dream who told her that the baby will be a girl. It came with a warning though. Either the mother or the child would die; if both survived then the girl would be extraordinary. The goddess Cherachamdinliu, the daughter of Bhuban cave, is said to have entered the womb of Karotlenliu, being born as Gaidinliu on 26th January 1915. Location: Lungkao, Manipur.',

            description: ' In 1931, Jadonang was captured and hanged by the British after being implicated on false charges of ‘human sacrifice’. Gaidinliu, his close collaborator, escaped with a large number of followers to the North Cachar hills in Assam. Gaidinliu is then captured by the British. A fellow Naga, Dr. Haralu, is accused by her followers of conniving with the Extra Assistant Commissioner, Hari Blah, and Captain Macdonald of the paramilitary force, the Assam Rifles, and this led to her captivity in Pulomi village in the Naga hills in 1932.
